    NEW GAME IDEAS:

 
        one room holds the station's power generator (destroy with bomb)

        one room (on border) holds the airlock exit (escape = win)

        Otto is a roaming automazeon, and shoots very fast and very often

        robots have hitpoints and don't blow up, they are "deactivated"

        you can sap the energy from any deactivated automazeon (light -> dark)

        you have hitpoint, maybe 10 pts

        Otto has mucho hitpoints

        walls don't kill, they take away hp, as does lazer blasts

        a larger world exists, and doors are sealed and one-way.

        pick up bombs, drop them, they detonate in 10 seconds (break walls?)
           wait, why bombs?
